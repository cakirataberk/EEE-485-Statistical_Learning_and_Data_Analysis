# EEE-485-Statistical_Learning_and_Data_Analysis
Project Implementation of EEE485 Statistical Learning and Data Analysis, Bilkent University

In this project, we focused on predicting NBA regular season gamesâ€™ outcomes. Due to the binary outcome of the NBA games, we worked on the classification problem instances and possible solutions. Then, we decided to work on Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machine Classifier. Our solutions are focusing on binary classification; hence, the results interpreted as win (1) or lose (0).
